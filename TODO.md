#### Tasks Done

- [x] When user clicks on any contribution other than the one having the 'Pending' status, the Accept and Cancel buttons will be disabled.
- [x]

#### TBD

- [x] Show RRSP and TFSA amount on any individual contribution.
- [x] Show RRSP and TFSA amount on any edit page of individual contribution.
- [x] When user chooses to cancel their upcoming contribution we need to ask for confirmation.

#### Good to consider

- [x] Can we change the `Cancel` button in the Edit section to `Delete this contribution`? This way, users will not get the impression that they are canceling the Edit modal.
