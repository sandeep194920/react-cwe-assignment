#### Tasks Done

- [x] When user clicks on any contribution other than the one having the 'Pending' status, the Accept and Cancel buttons will be disabled.

- [x] When a user clicks on a pending contribution and attempts to delete it, we display a delete confirmation message. If the user accepts the confirmation message, we proceed to delete it.

- [x] Changed the `Cancel` button in the Edit section to `Delete`? This way, users will not get the impression that they are canceling the Edit modal.

#### TBD

- [x] Show RRSP and TFSA amount on any individual contribution.
- [x] Show RRSP and TFSA amount on any edit & delete pages of individual contribution.

#### Good to consider

- [x] When the user tries to change the RRSP and TFSA amounts in the selected contribution, we can add certain validations. They can be as follows:
  - [x] To check if they entered right numbers within the range.
  - [x] To also check if the amount they entered for both RRSP and TFSA both exactly add up to their contribution.
